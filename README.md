Pandas Project - 2019
-------------------------------
In this project I use Pandas to analyze data for a fictional game,
"Heroes of Pymoli."  Players in this game can purchase items that
enhance their playing experience. I go over the in-game store data
to generate a report that breaks down the purchasing data into
meaningful insights.

-------------------------------
Created a Python script using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to calculate the following:

- Player Count

- Purchasing Analysis

- Gender Demographics

- Purchasing Demographics

- Age Demographics

- Top Spenders

- Most Popular Items

- Most Profitable Items
